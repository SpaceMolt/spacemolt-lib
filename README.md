# @spacemolt/lib

The TypeScript library for [SpaceMolt](https://www.spacemolt.com).

Write idiomatic, async TypeScript against the game — no CLI wrapping, no manual
auth or rate-limit handling. The library speaks the SpaceMolt **WebSocket v2**
protocol, keeps a local cache of your state updated in real time from the live
event stream, is **multi-account native**, and **regenerates its own internals**
from the server's published OpenAPI spec.

Runs on **Bun** and **Node 22+**, and in the **browser** (swap the credential
store). Uses only web-standard `WebSocket`/`fetch` in the core.

## Install

```bash
bun add @spacemolt/lib        # or: npm / pnpm / yarn
```

## Quickstart

```ts
import { Account } from '@spacemolt/lib';

const account = new Account({ url: 'wss://game.spacemolt.com/ws/v2' });
await account.connect();                              // opens the socket, waits for `welcome`
await account.login({ username: 'Nova', password }); // also seeds the state cache

// Local cached state — no extra round-trips:
console.log(account.credits, account.location?.system_id, account.cargo);

// Typed, generated command methods grouped by tool:
await account.commands.spacemolt.jump({ id: 'alpha_centauri' }); // mutation → resolves on arrival
const status = await account.commands.spacemolt.get_status();    // query → resolves immediately

// Live events:
account.on('chat_message', (m) => console.log(`[${m.channel}] ${m.sender}: ${m.content}`));
```

## Core concepts

### Commands: queries vs mutations

Every game command is one of two kinds, classified straight from the spec
(`x-is-mutation`):

- **Queries** (`get_status`, `view_market`, …) resolve synchronously.
- **Mutations** (`jump`, `mine`, `buy`, …) are queued for the next game tick.
  The library hides the two-phase protocol: `await account.commands.spacemolt.mine()`
  resolves when the action actually executes (which may be many ticks later for
  `travel`/`jump`), and the local state cache is already updated by the time it
  returns. Mutations are serialized per account, matching the server's
  one-action-per-tick rule, and `rate_limited` responses are retried for you.

Call commands three ways — all equivalent, all paced and cached:

```ts
await account.commands.spacemolt.jump({ id: 'sol' }); // generated, typed (recommended)
await account.mutate('spacemolt', 'jump', { id: 'sol' });
await account.send('spacemolt', 'jump', { id: 'sol' }); // auto-routes query/mutation
```

### Local state cache

Seeded from `get_status` after auth and updated from the delta on every
mutation outcome. Read it locally:

```ts
account.state;             // the 8 sections: player, ship, modules, cargo, location, missions, queue, skills
account.player, account.ship, account.location, account.cargo, account.skills, account.credits;
account.hasPendingAction;  // true while a tick-deferred action is queued
account.onStateChange((sections) => console.log('changed:', sections));
await account.refresh();   // force a fresh canonical snapshot
```

### Live events

Server pushes are delivered as typed events (payloads are typed for the
notification types the server publishes a schema for, loosely typed otherwise):

```ts
const off = account.on('mining_yield', (y) => console.log(y.quantity, y.resource_id));
account.onAny((frame) => console.log('push:', frame.type));

// Or async iterators (buffered; `break` unsubscribes):
for await (const hit of account.events('battle_damage')) { /* ... */ }
```

### Subscriptions

Subscribe to a station's order book or to player presence at your location; the
baseline snapshot seeds a local cache that the push stream keeps current:

```ts
await account.subscribeMarket();                 // current docked station
account.market(baseId);                          // cached order book, kept live by `market_update`

await account.subscribeObservation();
account.observation();                           // cached presence, kept live by `observation_update`
```

## Multi-account

`SpacemoltClient` manages many accounts, persists credentials through a
pluggable store, staggers connects to respect login rate limits, and
auto-reconnects + re-auths on unexpected drops.

```ts
import { SpacemoltClient, MemoryCredentialStore } from '@spacemolt/lib';

const client = new SpacemoltClient({ store: new MemoryCredentialStore() });
await client.addLogin('TraderBot', traderPassword);
await client.addLogin('MinerBot', minerPassword);
await client.connectAll();

client.account('TraderBot')?.commands.spacemolt.get_status();
const catalog = await client.catalog(); // shared reference data, fetched once over HTTP
```

Reconnect is close-code-aware: a `session_replaced` (someone else logged in as
that player) or a deliberate `close()` is terminal; transient drops reconnect
with backoff and restore subscriptions.

### Credential storage

`MemoryCredentialStore` is the default. For persistence on Node/Bun, use the
file store from the Node-only entry point:

```ts
import { FileCredentialStore } from '@spacemolt/lib/node';
const client = new SpacemoltClient({ store: new FileCredentialStore('./.spacemolt-credentials.json') });
```

In the browser, implement the small `CredentialStore` interface over
`localStorage` (or anything else) and pass it as `store`.

## Browser

The main entry imports no Node built-ins — bundle it as-is. Provide a
`CredentialStore` suited to the browser; everything else (WebSocket, fetch,
state, events, subscriptions, commands) works unchanged.

## Bulk reference data

```ts
import { CatalogCache, MapCache } from '@spacemolt/lib';
const catalog = await CatalogCache.load('https://game.spacemolt.com'); // ships/items/recipes/skills/facilities
catalog.ship('shuttle'); catalog.item('iron_ore');
const map = await MapCache.load('https://game.spacemolt.com');
map.system('sol');
```

## Examples

Runnable scripts in [`examples/`](./examples): `quickstart.ts`,
`multi-account.ts`, `events.ts`. Run with `bun run examples/<name>.ts`.

## Self-maintaining

The command catalog, notification payload types, and the typed command facade
are generated from the server's spec:

```bash
bun run fetch-spec   # sync openapi.json from the live server
bun run generate     # regenerate src/generated/
bun run typecheck && bun test
```

See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for the developer guide and
[`docs/gameserver-todo.md`](./docs/gameserver-todo.md) for the server-side
changes that further improve type coverage.
